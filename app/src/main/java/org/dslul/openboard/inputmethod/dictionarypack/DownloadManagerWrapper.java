/**
 * A class to help with calling DownloadManager methods.
 *
 * Mostly, the problem here is that most methods from DownloadManager may throw SQL exceptions if
 * they can't open the database on disk. We want to avoid crashing in these cases but can't do
 * much more, so this class insulates the callers from these. SQLiteException also inherit from
 * RuntimeException so they are unchecked :(
 * While we're at it, we also insulate callers from the cases where DownloadManager is disabled,
 * and getSystemService returns null.
