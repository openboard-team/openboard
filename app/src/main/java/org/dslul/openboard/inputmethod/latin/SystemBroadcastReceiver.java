/**
 * This class detects the {@link Intent#ACTION_MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED} broadcast intent when this IME
 * package has been replaced by a newer version of the same package. This class also detects
 * {@link Intent#ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED} and {@link Intent#ACTION_USER_INITIALIZE} broadcast intent.
 *
 * If this IME has already been installed in the system image and a new version of this IME has
 * been installed, {@link Intent#ACTION_MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED} is received by this receiver and it
 * will hide the setup wizard's icon.
 *
 * If this IME has already been installed in the data partition and a new version of this IME has
 * been installed, {@link Intent#ACTION_MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED} is received by this receiver but it
 * will not hide the setup wizard's icon, and the icon will appear on the launcher.
 *
 * If this IME hasn't been installed yet and has been newly installed, no
 * {@link Intent#ACTION_MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED} will be sent and the setup wizard's icon will appear
 * on the launcher.
 *
 * When the device has been booted, {@link Intent#ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED} is received by this
 * receiver and it checks whether the setup wizard's icon should be appeared or not on the launcher
 * depending on which partition this IME is installed.
 *
 * When the system locale has been changed, {@link Intent#ACTION_LOCALE_CHANGED} is received by
 * this receiver and the {@link KeyboardLayoutSet}'s cache is cleared.
