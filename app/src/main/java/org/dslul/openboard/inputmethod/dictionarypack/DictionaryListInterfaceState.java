/**
 * Helper class to maintain the interface state of word list preferences.
 *
 * This is necessary because the views are created on-demand by calling code. There are many
 * situations where views are renewed with little relation with user interaction. For example,
 * when scrolling, the view is reused so it doesn't keep its state, which means we need to keep
 * it separately. Also whenever the underlying dictionary list undergoes a change (for example,
 * update the metadata, or finish downloading) the whole list has to be thrown out and recreated
 * in case some dictionaries appeared, disappeared, changed states etc.
